<strong>Bone and Mineral Diagnostic Testing Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Bone and mineral metabolism disorder is a collective term used to describe various conditions that make bones weak. Bone mineral metabolism maintains sufficient concentration of inorganic ions in blood serum. Progressive chronic kidney disease, especially end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is responsible for adverse changes in bone and mineral metabolism. Increase in serum parathyroid hormone levels due to fall in glomerular filtration rate is an indicator of bone disorder caused by chronic kidney disease. Reduction in kidney function leads to changes in bone mineral homeostasis and in levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Disorders of mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been associated with higher mortality than anemia and inadequate dialysis.
